Lemonade is downstream frontend for  [bergamot](https://github.com/browsermt),
targeted for linux, maybe other \*nix.  

This is a loose compilation of multiple scripts, with no care for dependencies
when put together should work on my machine. Highly opinionated, there's limited
configurability in the ultimate command-line tool or services provided by this
repository.

For library, cross-platfrom, configurability look at the applications offered
by [bergamot-translator](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator).
